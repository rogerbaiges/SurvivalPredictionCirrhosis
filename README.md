# SurvivalPredictionCirrhosis

## Overview
This project aims to leverage advanced machine learning techniques to predict survival rates in cirrhosis patients, supporting clinical decisions and advancing personalized medicine.

## Techniques Used
- **Data Preprocessing**: Implementation of missing value treatment, outlier management, and dataset balancing techniques.
- **Variable Preparation**: Conducting feature normalization and correlation analysis for optimal model input.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Trees
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - **Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)**: An advanced ensemble technique providing model interpretability alongside performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Applying cross-validation techniques, SMOTE for oversampling, and RandomUnderSampler for undersampling to validate model efficacy.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Employed to identify distinct patient groups based on survival factors, enhancing the model's ability to cater to diverse patient profiles.

## Results
The combination of traditional machine learning models with advanced techniques like EBM and hierarchical clustering has led to a robust prediction system. This system not only achieves high accuracy in survival prediction but also ensures the results are interpretable by healthcare professionals, paving the way for its application in clinical environments.

## Conclusion
The Cirrhosis Survival Prediction Project stands as a testament to the potential of integrating machine learning into healthcare. Through precise predictions and actionable insights, it promises to revolutionize patient care for those suffering from cirrhosis, demonstrating a significant step forward in the field of medical technology.
